# Model Creation Script Readme

This script is designed to facilitate the creation of a `model_index.json` file by importing a model stored in the SafeTensors format (`.safetensors`). The resulting `model_index.json` file will contain essential information about the model for reference and later use.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**: Ensure you have a Python environment with the required dependencies installed.

   ```
   pip install safetensors
   ```

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Prepare Model**: Place your SafeTensors model file (`model.safetensors`) in a directory accessible from the script.

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script `create_model_index.py` using the following command:

   ```
   python create_model_index.py
   ```

4. **Output**: Upon successful execution, the script will generate a `model_index.json` file containing the model's metadata and information about the tensors.

## Script Explanation

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Import Dependencies**: The script imports the required dependencies, including `json` and `safe_open` from `safetensors`.

2. **Load SafeTensors Model**: The script uses `safe_open` to load the SafeTensors model from the specified path. The `framework` and `device` parameters can be adjusted as needed.

3. **Create `model_index.json`**: The script creates a dictionary named `model_index` that holds essential information about the model, such as the model's identifier, file paths, and tensor information.

4. **Save JSON File**: The script saves the generated `model_index` dictionary as a JSON file named `model_index.json` in the specified directory.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace `"path/to/model.safetensors"` with the actual path to your SafeTensors model file.
- Update the `"model"` field in the `model_index` dictionary with your preferred model identifier.
- Customize the output file path (`"path/to/model_index.json"`) according to your needs.
